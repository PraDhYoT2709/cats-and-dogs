# Cats and Dogs Classification using Deep Learning


## About Cats and Dogs Prediction Project
In this project, we will be using a Convolutional Neural Network to create our model which will predict whether the image is of dog or cat. We will create a GUI in which we will directly upload the image and predict whether the image contains a dog or cat.

## Dataset we will be using:
In this we will be using the famous dataset that is the Asirra( animal species image recognition for restricting access) dataset, which was introduced in 2013 for a machine learning competition. The dataset consist of 25,000 images with equal numbers of cats and dogs.

## Libraries required
-Numpy

-Pandas

-Matplotlib

-Tensorflow

-Keras

-sklearn
